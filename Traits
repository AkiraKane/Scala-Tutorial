Mehtods and field definitions are infact wrapped into traits. These can be reused by extending them into classes.
Unlike inheritance, a class can extend any no.of traits.

To aovid confusion and for people who are trying hard to makeout what trait meand and how it could be used in class,
trait can very well compared to abstract classes in Java.
