SCALA VARIABLES:

Variables are memory locations reserverd to store values of that particular data type of the variable.

Declaration:

var myVar : String = "hello"

Here myVar is declared using the keyword var which means the variable is mutable (i.e it can change the value).

val myVal : String = "padma"

Here myVal is declared using the keyword val which means it cannot be changed i.e immutable.

Variable Data Type:
Unlike Java, the data type of the variable is specified after the variable name and before equal sign.
Syntax: var or val VariableName : DataType [=Initial value]

variable declaration in Java: int x=10;
variable declaration in Scala: var x :int =10;
