Introduction to Scala

Scala is developed by Martin Odersky and released in 2003. It integrates features of object oriented 
and functional languages.
Scala --> means scalable language. It is compiled and runs on JVM.
Scala is pure object oriented --> which means every value is treated as object.
Scala is functional --> every function is a value. Since every value is an object, every function is an object.
Scala is statically typed --> means type of the variable is known at compile time. It doesnâ€™t expect 
to provide redundant type information.
Static typed vs Dynamic typed: In case of static typed languages, type of the variable is known at compile time. 
For dynamic typing, type of the variable is interpreted at runtime.

Scala runs on JVM --> Scala code compiles into java byte code which is executed by jvm.
Both java and scala have a common runtime platform. 

scalac --> to compile scala code
scala --> to run the byte code

scalac and scala commands are same as javac and java

Steps to install/run scala:

On Windows:

1. Java setup is required (java 1.5 or greater is required)
2. Download scala from http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads
   In windows, if its .msi installer, run the file as admin, accept license agreement and install it in 
   some directory (as Drive:\Scala\..) or in the default location as C:\Program Files\Scala\..

3. scala -version
   The above command displays the scala version that is installed
   
On Linux:
1. As discussed above , java is the pre-requisite for installing scala.
2. Download scala jar which looks as scala-<version>-installer.jar.
3. Now execute the following command:
   java -jar scala-2.9.0.1-installer.jar
4. During the installation process, accept the license agreement, specify the path where scala has to be installed
   (eg: /usr/local/share).
5. Finally, scala -version at the command prompt displays the version of scala that is installed.
