Scala Sets:
It is a collection of pairwise different elements of same type. The key distinct feature of set is that it doesn't contain duplicte elements.
There are two kinds of sets- immutable and mutable.
By default, scala sets are immutable. If we want to use mutable set, import scala.collection.mutable.Set class.
immutable set refers to as Set and we can refer the mutable set as mutable.Set

Declare Immutable set:
var s:Set[Int]=Set() //Empty set of integer type
var s:Set[Int]=Set(1,3,5,7)
var s=Set(1,3,5,7)

Basic Operations on Set:
head -> returns first element of the set
tail -> returns a set containing all the elements except the first
isEmpty -> returns tru if the set is empty otherwise false

Example:
val fruit = Set("apples", "oranges", "pears")

println( "Head of fruit : " + fruit.head )
println( "Tail of fruit : " + fruit.tail )
println( "Check if fruit is empty : " + fruit.isEmpty )
println( "Check if nums is empty : " + nums.isEmpty )

Result:
Head of fruit : apples
Tail of fruit : Set(oranges, pears)
Check if fruit is empty : false
Check if nums is empty : true
